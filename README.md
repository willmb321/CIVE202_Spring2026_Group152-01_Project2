This GitHub page houses all the deliverable files for the NDOT Concrete Mix Design Project.

### Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to modernize the NDOT's concrete mix calculations with Python. The client has requested four main tasks: (1) A translation of their Excel mix design document into a Python script with defined functions, (2) The Python script must prompt to the user for the required design elements in the same order as the Excel document, (3) The Python script must return a detailed final mix design chart based off the gather data, and (4) To test the Python program with 4 realistic mix designs.
